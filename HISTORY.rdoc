= RELEASE HISTORY

1.0.1 / 2010-09-03

This release merely updates some project metadata. No functional
changes have been made.

Changes:

* Update matedata; resource point to 'wedge' project.


1.0.0 / 2010-08-01

This is the initialize release of the Gem Wedge Plugin, and may well
be the only release since it is simply a thin wrapper around the
wedge gem's built-in library `wedge/gem.rb` library, converting
it into a RubyGems plugin.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
